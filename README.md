Plant Pal

Created a smart soil moisture monitoring system powered by an ESP32 microcontroller, delivering real-time moisture readings on an LCD screen to support better plant care. Integrated a power booster and rechargeable battery system to ensure continuous, long-term operation without the need for frequent maintenance. 
Designed and 3D-modeled a custom enclosure in Fusion 360, enhancing the sensorâ€™s durability, usability, and overall aesthetic, while developing the hardware layout and PCB in KiCad for a fully integrated solution.
